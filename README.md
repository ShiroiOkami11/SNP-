# SNP+

- This mod shold work with any other starbound mod(in theory). If this is conflicting with something please tell me and i'll fix it.

- This mods will add a "great" Starbound relations npc-npc-player you will be allowed to have friends, rivals, enemies, lovers and a husband or wife(or multiple wives/hubands(i'll need to work to implement something with multiple realistic cases on RL to it...)). 

- The mod will add also Race relation effect that will affect o individual relations in the start until you prove the opposite to some individuals from some races.

- You will be chased the race if you take itens broke blocks and harm them. Your base will be raided(the idea is that lol)

# Why did i created this mod??

- The main reason is that i always wanted something like this but the Starbound mod community is empty of good modders and generally most of them don't try go further anyhing that can implement the original code logic from Starbound just adding itens armor races craftings but actually nothing trying something like changing the NPC and stuff. My objective here is to motivate people to try and think a bit out of the box and even further out of the box to make this modding community great despite some obstacles on it... 

- The second reason is that i have a dream to see the modding community of Starbound grow and maybe one day we be like Starbound and Rimworld modding commuities with such great variety of mods that not only change or add new funiture, itens, armor, weapons but alter the gameplay mechanics from starbound and transform it like for example: Save our ship 2 from the Rimworld mod community that let's you have space ship battles and even go to other planet(Despite killing your collonist in the process to allow the others to go to another planet and thi planet havinf the same or radom settings created by rimworld, but hey, mods and games aren't perfect...)
